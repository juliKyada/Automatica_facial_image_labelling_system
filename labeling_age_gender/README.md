##  Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
python facial_labelling_gui.py
```

### Single Image Analysis
1. Click **" Upload Image"** to select an image file
2. Click **" Predict"** to analyze the image
3. View detailed results including:
   - Predicted age
   - Predicted gender
   - Confidence scores
   - Raw model outputs

### Batch Processing
1. Click **" Batch Process"** to select a folder of images
2. Monitor progress with the progress bar
3. View results in the "Batch Results" tab
4. Export results using **" Export Results"**

### Supported Image Formats
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- BMP (.bmp)
- TIFF (.tiff)

## üîß Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- **Age Prediction**: Regression model with MSE loss
- **Gender Prediction**: Binary classification with binary crossentropy loss
- **Input Size**: 48x48 pixels (RGB)
- **Preprocessing**: Resize to 48x48, normalize to [0,1]

### Pseudo-labelling Approach
The system uses a small amount of manually labelled data combined with predictions from pre-trained models to create a larger training dataset, improving model performance through semi-supervised learning.

### Performance Metrics
- **Age Prediction**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Gender Prediction**: Binary accuracy
- **Model Validation**: 20% test split with cross-validation

##  Results Interpretation

### Age Prediction
- Output: Integer age in years (0-100)
- Confidence: Based on model's regression output variance

### Gender Prediction
- Output: Male/Female classification
- Confidence: Probability score (0.0-1.0)
- Threshold: 0.5 (above = Male, below = Female)

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Models not loading**
   - Ensure `age_gender_pseudolabel.h5` is in the same directory
   - Check TensorFlow installation and version compatibility

2. **Memory errors during batch processing**
   - Reduce batch size or process fewer images at once
   - Close other applications to free up memory

3. **Image loading errors**
   - Verify image file integrity
   - Check supported file formats
   - Ensure sufficient disk space

### Performance Tips
- Use SSD storage for faster image loading
- Close unnecessary applications during batch processing
- Process images in smaller batches for large datasets
